# Using-Regression-Model-with-Abalone-Data-In-PyCaret

# Abstract
This work focused on utilizing regression analysis techniques to anticipate the age of abalones based on the number of rings. The analysis was conducted using the Abalone dataset. Our method primarily focused on preparing the data to ensure optimal analysis. This required normalization and encoding techniques, followed by the utilization of complex regression models. Out of all the many algorithms that were examined, CatBoost Regression showed exceptional results. The efficacy of the model was thoroughly assessed through the use of measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared values. The conclusive outcomes demonstrated the model's adeptness in precisely forecasting the age of abalones with an R-squared value, signifying a notable degree of prediction precision. This work showcases the efficacy of machine learning in analyzing biological data and also opens up possibilities for novel methodologies in marine biology research, which can have tangible applications in conservation and ecological studies.
